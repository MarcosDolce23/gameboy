# <img src='https://github.com/nectarboy/gameboy/blob/main/docs/logo_small.png?raw=true'> Pollen Boy !

## Introduction
hey ! this is pollen boy, my very own gameboy emulator. it is written in pure javascript,
and you can [try it online here !](https://nectarboy.github.io/gameboy)
it has most of the gameboys features, such as controls, display, etc

its not meant to be the fastest or most accurate emulator,
but it passes the basic tests, runs most games i tried,
and runs pretty smoothly considering i made this on a thinkpad uwu

with all this, pollen boy is still a wip, and might have some janky bugs somewhere idk,
so be nice to it <3
if u have any feedback, criticism, or issues to say tell me !

## Features
### Emulation
pollen boy has all the basic aspects of the gameboy, though its not emulated cycle accurately at all;
i dont completely emulate **everything** about some aspects (... *yet*), like DMA or the HALT instruction.

but so far, i think it holds up pretty good, heres what it has uwu
- gameboy DMG CPU (no color !)
- PPU and display
- audio (PHAAT WIP)
- joypad
- save files
- interrupts and timers
- memory banking (support for bigger games)

### Teensies
pollen boy has a lot of what ill call teensies (lil features not related to the gb itself)

right now, pollen boy has the basic teensies, but not a lot of q.o.l ones, it got:
- load ROMS
- pause and reset
- export / import saves
- a list of palletes i compiled that you can choose from

## How To Use
open the webpage, click <kbd>Choose ROM</kbd> and enjoy !
the default controls are:
```
D-Pad: Arrow Keys
B: X
A: Z
Start: Enter
Select: Right Shift
```
(you cant customize them ... *yet* ... i told u this was a wip ok)

## Settings
### Save Files
if a game has save support, you can click <kbd>Export</kbd> to download the save on your drive.
you can then <kbd>Import</kbd> save files onto games to continue your progress !

### Color Palletes
you can swap the colors from a list of palletes i made, including my own, my sisters (mwah btw), and others i found on the internet. i love this feature so love it too. or else.

p.s: palletes dont actually change the games pallete, it just customizes the 4 colors the gameboy can use.
